    "# Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "To address the research questions outlined in the Project Overview, high-quality data on annual free-agent classes, player statistics, biographical information, awards, and salaries is required. Two primary data sources were used for this project: the **Lahman Baseball Database** and the **MLB Stats API**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limitations of the raw datasets helped define the final cleaned dataset spanning **2003–2015**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The MLB Stats API provides **no free-agent data prior to 2003** and lack of salary data for contracts signed.\n",
    "- The Lahman Database provides **salary data only through 2017**, with most reliable salary records ending after 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support these constraints, Lahman data was pulled for the years **2000–2017**. This ensures that player salaries could be averaged over contract lengths of at least two years and that performance statistics from prior seasons could be accumulated appropriately. This range also allows three-year performance averages to be computed for the earliest MLB Stats API free-agent cohort (2003). Free-agent signing data from the MLB Stats API was collected for the years **2003–2015**, ensuring that all three-year performance averages and salary calculations could be performed consistently across seasons, especially given the lack of reliable salary data after 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other data sources with higher-fidelity contract and salary information; however, many require agreements restricting their use for predictive modeling (e.g., Baseball Reference) or are locked behind paid subscriptions. Although the Lahman Database and MLB Stats API each have important limitations, together they provide a strong, freely accessible foundation for this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The descriptions below summarize the key modeling variables extracted from each dataset. Because each dataset contains many more variables, the full versions are available in the [project repository](https://github.com/nw93929/DS6021-Project).\n",

    "\n",
    "The Lahman Baseball Database provides a comprehensive historical record of Major League Baseball, including tables covering **players**, **batting**, **fielding**, **pitching**, **awards**, **teams**, and **salaries**. The dataset includes performance statistics through **2025** and salary data through **2017**, with the primary limitation being the absence of salary information after 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains many of the variables necessary for predicting free-agent salaries, such as performance statistics, award histories, demographic information, and historical salary data. Access to the Lahman tables was facilitated through the **Pylahman** Python package, which provides a convenient interface for loading Lahman data into pandas DataFrames.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **MLB Stats API**, maintained by Major League Baseball, provides an endpoint that returns **free-agent signings by year**. This allows us to gather complete free-agent classes for each offseason, which is essential for modeling player contract outcomes. Although the API also includes information on minor-league contracts, this analysis focuses exclusively on **Major League contracts**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free-agent signing data was retrieved using the **BaseballR** package and exported as a CSV covering the years **2003–2015**. When combined with player statistics and salary data from the Lahman Dataset, this API enables the construction of a comprehensive dataset for predicting player AAV and contract length.\n",

    "# Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform the acquired datasets into a unified and comprehensive analytical dataset, two major phases of cleaning were required to merge the MLB Stats API and Lahman datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contract Length Extraction and Player Name Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract contract information from the MLB Stats API and align players with their corresponding records in the Lahman dataset, several preprocessing steps were performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1. Player Name Normalization**  \n",
    "  A dictionary was created to map each player’s cleaned first–last name combination to their Lahman `playerID`.  \n",
    "  - Removed internal spaces in first names.  \n",
    "  - Standardized formatting of names.  \n",
    "  - Removed accented characters (e.g., “José” → “Jose”) to avoid mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2. Cleaning Player Names from Free-Agent Data**  \n",
    "  Player names in the free-agent dataset were standardized to improve matching accuracy:  \n",
    "  - Removed accented characters.  \n",
    "  - Stripped suffixes such as *Jr.*, *Sr.*, *II*, *III*, *IV*.  \n",
    "  - Removed middle names, keeping only first and last names.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3. Mapping Free Agents to Lahman Player IDs**  \n",
    "  Each cleaned free-agent name was matched against the name–ID dictionary.  \n",
    "  - Successful matches were assigned a Lahman `playerID`.  \n",
    "  - Unmatched records were skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **4. Extracting Contract Length from Text Descriptions**  \n",
    "  Contract length appears only in free-text fields and required parsing:  \n",
    "  - Detected digit-based patterns (e.g., “3-year”, “10 year”).  \n",
    "  - If digits were absent, detected written numbers (e.g., “One-year”) and converted them into integers.  \n",
    "  - Records without clear contract length were marked as missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **5. Building a Contract Dictionary**  \n",
    "  A dictionary was created mapping each `playerID` to all (year, contract length) pairs found in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **6. Removing Duplicate Contract Entries**  \n",
    "  To prevent redundancy:  \n",
    "  - Duplicate (year, contract length) entries for each player were removed.  \n",
    "  - Chronological order was preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process resulted in a structured mapping of each free agent to their contract year and length, enabling accurate modeling of contract outcomes.\n",

    "## High-Level Overview of Feature Engineering Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a summary of the major steps used to engineer all player-level features from pitching, batting, fielding, salary, and awards data. These features serve as inputs for predicting AAV and multi-year contract likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1. Compute 3-Year Performance Statistics**  \n",
    "  - Retrieve statistics for the three seasons prior to free agency.  \n",
    "  - **Pitchers:** sum counting stats (e.g., strikeouts, innings pitched) and average rate stats (e.g., ERA, BAOpp).  \n",
    "  - **Batters:** sum all batting counting stats across three seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2. Extract Fielding Metrics and Primary Position**  \n",
    "  - Aggregate putouts, assists, errors, etc., over the same three-year window.  \n",
    "  - Average Zone Rating (ZR).  \n",
    "  - Determine primary on-field position based on most frequently played position.  \n",
    "  - If fielding data is missing, create a placeholder row of `NaN` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **3. Calculate Player Age at Free Agency**  \n",
    "  - Compute age by subtracting birth year from the free-agency year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **4. Generate Unique Player-Season Identifiers**  \n",
    "  - Create a unique ID combining `playerID` and the free-agency year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **5. Compute Average Annual Salary (AAV)**  \n",
    "  - Using contract length and Lahman salary data, average salaries over the years following contract signing.  \n",
    "  - Only years up to 2017 are included due to data limitations.\n",
    "  - **Edge Case:** If a contract signed in 2015 had a length of five years, only the available salary values for 2016 and 2017 could be used. In these cases, the AAV was calculated by dividing the total known salary values by the number of years with available data, rather than the full contract length.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **6. Retrieve Contract Length**  \n",
    "  - Pull contract length from the constructed contract dictionary.  \n",
    "  - Values with missing or invalid length are marked as missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **7. Extract Awards and All-Star Indicators**  \n",
    "  - Check whether the player won awards within the past three seasons:  \n",
    "    - Cy Young  \n",
    "    - MVP  \n",
    "    - Gold Glove  \n",
    "    - Silver Slugger  \n",
    "    - All-Star appearances  \n",
    "  - Represent each as a binary (0/1) feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **8. Compute League-Average Salary for the Season**  \n",
    "  - Calculate the mean salary across all MLB players for the free-agency year.  \n",
    "  - Used as contextual information to normalize contract value expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This high-level cleaning and feature-engineering pipeline ensures that each free agent has a complete set of structured features describing performance, awards, experience, fielding ability, contract outcomes, and league context—enabling robust predictive modeling for both **AAV** and **multi-year contract probability**.
